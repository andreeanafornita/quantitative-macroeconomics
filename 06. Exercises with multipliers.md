## Exercise 1

_Consider the case of an open economy:_  
- $c = 0.9$
- $t = \dfrac{1}{3}$

---

If $BD$ increased by 15 mil. &euro; determine:  
(a) the change in investment that could have lead to this increase in $BD$
> $\Delta I = ?$  

(b) if the increase in $BD$ is due only to the increase in $G$, what is $\Delta G = ?$

---

Write the model:  

$$\begin{cases}
    y = C + I + G\\
    C = C_0 + c \cdot y^D\\
    y^D = y - T + Tr\\
    T = T_0 + t \cdot y\\
    I = \overline I\\
    G = \overline G\\
    NX = \overline{NX}\\
\end{cases}$$

> We use the bar above $I, G$ and $NX$ only to show they are constant, as in later seminars we will consider $I$ to not be constant, so basically there's no change for now

> If an economy is open that means we have $NX$ in the model  
> If an economy is closed that means we **don't** have $NX$ in the model
